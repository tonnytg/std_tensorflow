# TensorFlow.js Image Processing Example

This project demonstrates how to use TensorFlow.js with Node.js to process an image file. The code reads a local image, converts it into a tensor, performs some basic analysis (like calculating the average color values), and generates a grayscale version of the image.

## Features

- Converts a local image into an RGB tensor.
- Analyzes the image dimensions and average color values.
- Evaluates the brightness of the image and prints a fun message.
- Converts the image into grayscale and saves it as a new file.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need:

1. **Node.js** (version 16 or higher is recommended).
2. **TensorFlow.js** for Node.js:
   ```bash
   npm install @tensorflow/tfjs-node
